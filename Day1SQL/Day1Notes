# today I learned basics of sql
1.basic syntax
2.create , alter , drop (ddl commands)
3.update , insert (dml commands)
4.select (dql command)
5.where and having
6.JOINS (inner,outer,left,right)
7.cross join
8.Aggregate functions
9.Group by


# Question:1 What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?

Explain:

When each is executed

Why HAVING cannot replace WHERE

Example use case

Answer:both where and having is used for filteration ,only difference is that where is used before group by while 
       having is used after group by

       HAVING works on aggregated results.

       If you use HAVING without GROUP BY, it behaves differently.

       Using HAVING instead of WHERE can reduce performance    

#Question 2:Difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(column_name)?

What happens if column contains NULLs?

Answer: COUNT(*) Counts the total number of rows in the result set or a table.
        Counts the number of non-NULL values in the specified column.

# Question:2 In LC 183, why do we check o.id IS NULL instead of o.customerId IS NULL?

Answer:we check o.id is null because 
       id is the primary key of Orders.

       zIf it is NULL → no matching order exists.

# Question:3 Why is LIMIT dangerous in some interview problems?

When is it appropriate? When is it wrong?

Answer: because it can be used to hide a lack of understanding of data integrity, sorting, or complex join logic.

# Question:4 What happens if there are duplicate keys in JOIN?

How does it affect row count?

Answer: the duplicate rows will be included in result.
        row count increases as duplicate rows also included.

# Question:5 In LC 182 (duplicate emails), which approach is more efficient:

GROUP BY

Self join

Answer: I think group by is more efficient 
        GROUP BY scans table once
        Self join compares rows against each other
        Self join increases computation cost
